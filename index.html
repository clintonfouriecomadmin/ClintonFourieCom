            <h3>This is part of my DevOps project and this site is still under construction!</h3>
                <p>My static website is pointing to my AWS s3 public bucket (DNS).
                <br>I have setup 2x development VM's (1x Windows 10 32bit and 1x Ubuntu 20.04 64bit)
                <br>The Windows 10 uses Git, GitKarken and it is set to commit to dev branch 01.
                <br>The Ubuntu runs Git, Visual studio Code and it is set to commit to dev branch 02.
                <br>I, myself run Windows 10 64bit with Git, Visual Studio Code and Github desktop.
                <br>I have tested the commits to the master branch from all sources but still need to test the commits to dev branches. 
                <br>I have linked my master branch to to AWS s3 bucket by creating a pipeline.
                <br>I have tested and all code commits exactly as I want it to with it updateing within seconds of my push.
                <br>I need to check the commit time on Github vs the commit time on AWS to see what the update time difference is!

                <p>DevOps pipelines are an investment and testing different solutions for different languages will become "DevOps Best Practise".
                <br>There are many solutions out there to choose from, some of these don't understand the fundamentals of networking principles.
                <br>Do you understand your OSI model, communication protocols or principles, App security, pipeline security, DNS leaks, Data leaks?
                <br>If not, then it will be much safer for you to keep everything under one umbrella, rather than trying to build out your pipeline
                <br>over secure or insecure connections. Just imagine someone intercepts your code during the commit phase or injects code into
                <br>your pipeline, whos going to tell the clients that every app is a potential hidden botnet. It is one thing, thinking your code
                <br>needs to be tried and tested, as your pipeline should also be monitored, patched and upgraded for any potential
                <br>vulnrabilities.
                <br>So you need your trusted and tested pipeline and you also need a "development pipeline" the one you can play around with.
                <br>A few more lines of text and this could become an Amazon Web Services add.
